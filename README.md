# MYCAPSTONE ON YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING AND WAREHOUSING 
These are the Capstone projects in Data Science
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project designed to empower users to access and analyse data from multiple YouTube channels effortlessly. It utilizes SQL, Pandas, and stream lit to craft a user-friendly application, enabling users to retrieve, store, and query YouTube channel and video data.
Here's a breakdown of the tools and libraries employed:
Stream lit: Utilized for creating an intuitive UI, stream lit enables seamless interaction for users to perform data retrieval and analysis tasks efficiently.
Python: Leveraging Python's simplicity and versatility, the project employs it as the primary language for the entire application development, encompassing data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualization.
Google API Client: By interfacing with YouTube's Data API v3, facilitated through the googleapiclient library, developers gain access to essential information like channel details, video specifics, and comments, streamlining data retrieval and manipulation tasks.
Pandas: Employed for storing data into data frames, Pandas facilitates easy transformation of data, preparing it for storage in SQL databases. It acts as an intermediary between the fetched data in Python and the SQL database.
MySQL: As an open-source and scalable DBMS, MySQL is chosen for its reliability and comprehensive feature set. It serves as the platform for storing and managing structured data, empowering efficient querying and analysis through its SQL capabilities.
The application boasts the following features: Retrieval of channel and video data from YouTube using the YouTube API.Storage of data in a MySQL database. Migration of data from the data frame to a SQL database for streamlined querying and analysis. Search and retrieval of data from the SQL database using various search options. In essence, YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing amalgamates powerful tools and libraries to provide users with a seamless experience in accessing and analysing YouTube data.
RESULT
Developing a user-friendly stream lit application that enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the stream lit app.
